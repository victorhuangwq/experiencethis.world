        <section id="strong-pokemon">
            <h2>1. Focus on Strong Pok√©mon</h2>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> In the limited card pool of a prerelease, you often don't have as many powerful cards to choose from as you would in a regular constructed deck.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Sort through the Pokemons that you pulled from the boosters, as well as your promotional card. Look for those with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High HP</strong> (helps them stay in play longer)</li>
                <li><strong>Damage-dealing attacks</strong> that cost a reasonable amount of Energy</li>
                <li><strong>Support abilities</strong> (e.g., draw power, Energy acceleration)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="pro-tip">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> At prerelease, two or three good attackers are usually enough. 
        </section>

        <section id="energy">
            <h2>2. Energy is Key ‚Äì Stick to One Type if unsure</h2>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> With only 40 cards and a limited pool, you want your Energy attachments to be consistent. Splitting between multiple Energy types can cause "dead hands" where you have the wrong Energy for the wrong Pok√©mon.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the type you want to focus on based on your strongest Pok√©mon, as per the previous section.</li>
                <li>Evaluate the cards that comes with your prerelease kit, especially the promo.</li>
                <li>Pokemon with colorless Energy requirements can be included in any deck.</li>
                <li>Aim for around <strong>10-14 Energy</strong> in a 40-card deck when focusing on a single type.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="pro-tip">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> There's a common stash of Energy cards available to use. 
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="trainers">
            <h2>3. Trainer Cards are Helpful</h2>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Trainer cards can often swing the momentum of a game by drawing extra cards, searching for specific Pok√©mon, or disrupting your opponent's plans.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Include Trainer cards</strong> that let you draw more cards, search your deck, or recover Pok√©mon/Energy from the discard pile.</li>
                <li><strong>Look for Supporters</strong> that help you cycle through your deck faster; pulling the right card at the right time can win a match.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="pro-tip">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even if you only have a handful of strong Pok√©mon, pairing them with enough consistency cards makes your deck more reliable.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="types">
            <h2>4. Type Matchups Matter (But Don't Overdo It)</h2>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Exploiting Weakness can help you take KOs more easily. However, in prereleases, your card pool is limited, so you don't want to chase too many different types just for potential matchups.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If you happen to pull</strong> a Pok√©mon that can exploit a commonly used type in the prerelease set, consider it.</li>
                <li><strong>Otherwise, stick to synergy and overall strength</strong> of your cards.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="pro-tip">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In a prerelease, it's often better to have a strong, focused deck than to chase niche matchups.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="evolution">
            <h2>5. Evolution is Powerful</h2>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Evolution cards in prerelease kits are often designed to be accessible, and they can have high impact for relatively low cost. Stage 2 Pok√©mon may be tough to get into play, but if they're strong, they can swing games.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check how easy it is to <strong>find or draw</strong> your Evolution line.</li>
                <li>If you pull multiple copies of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 line (and the lower stages), consider building around it.</li>
                <li>If your Stage 2 line is inconsistent or you only have one copy of the Basic and Stage 1, it might still be worth including if it's powerful enough to justify the risk.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="pro-tip">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're short on strong Stage 2 Pok√©mon or have incomplete lines, Stage 1 attackers are often more consistent and can still pack a punch.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="reading">
            <h2>6. Read Cards Carefully</h2>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Prerelease sets often introduce new mechanics or keyword abilities you might not be familiar with yet.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take time during deck building to read each card's text thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Don't miss details like <em>secondary effects</em> (e.g., special conditions, extra draw, Energy acceleration) that can change your strategy.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="pro-tip">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you're unsure how an effect interacts with another card, ask someone about it.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="deck-size">
            <h2>7. Aim for 40 Cards</h2>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The standard deck size at prereleases is 40 cards to allow for a faster pace with limited sets. Games are typically 4 Prize cards (instead of 6).</p>
            
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with about <strong>15‚Äì18 Pok√©mon, 8‚Äì12 Trainers, and 10‚Äì14 Energy</strong>. Adjust as needed based on your card pool.</li>
                <li>Keep your deck slim so you consistently draw what you need.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="pro-tip">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Prerelease deck building usually feels tight. If you're in doubt, lean toward <strong>consistency</strong> (extra draw/support, stable Energy lines) over risky combos.
