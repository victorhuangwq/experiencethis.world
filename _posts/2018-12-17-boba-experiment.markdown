[Boba Development blog](https://bobadevelopment.herokuapp.com/) is a personal pet project that I did to try out the NodeJS framework. Frontend, backend in the same language? Sounds amazing. It contains a minimally viable set of features for a blog CMS, including login sessions, ability to add, edit and remove posts using a WYSIWYG html editor.

You can find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/victorhuangwq/Boba-Experimental). 


Here's some FAQs to answer some of the questions you didn't know you had

> What is Boba?

[Bubble Tea](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boba)

> Why a Boba Blog?

Cause I like bubble tea, and I consider myself a connoisseur of this fine beverage. Having braved my calories count on them, I unilaterally decided that people would want to read my reviews about them.

> Some of your posts aren't really about Boba?

If you think about it (or don't), milk tea is just bubble tea without the bubbles. 

> Why do you write like a teenager?

Cause I wrote them when I was teenager. I wrote most of my reviews on Google Keep even before I had the web app, so it was a matter of posting them.

> Have you stopped drinking boba since December 2018?

No, but I have also moved on to better beverages in my life. (and also better things to do than writing about bubble tea...maybe)
