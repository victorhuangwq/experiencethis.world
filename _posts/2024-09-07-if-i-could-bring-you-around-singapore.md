So you're coming to Singapore! I'm very excited for you! Whether you are here for a short stopover or a longer stay, I hope you have a great time. 

I had the fortune of being a tour guide for quite a few friends who visited Singapore, and I've learnt a lot about what non-locals tend to like and dislike. I have also had friends who asked me for recommendations on what to do in Singapore - and I decided to organize my thoughts into this post.

Honestly, a big reason why I am writing this article is because I know that for most people, they might only visit Singapore once or twice in their lifetime, especially if they are not from the region. I mean - it would be the same for me if I were to visit a country in Europe. So I want to make sure that you have a good time - or at least, as ideal an impression of Singapore as possible.

# How to use this article

I organize my recommendations into *themed days*. This allows me to group attractions together based on their proximity to each other, and also based on the type of experience you can expect. What you can do is to mix and match the attractions based on your interests and time constraints.
