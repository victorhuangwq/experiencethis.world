Traditional approaches of identifying students who are struggling with class is **reactive**; course staff wait for students to come to them to provide help, which can often be too late. A **proactive** approach, where course staff can monitor student progress to identify struggling students would be much more beneficial.

In the Fall of 2020, I led the development of the [Autolab Project's](https://autolabproject.com/) new [metrics feature](https://docs.autolabproject.com/features/metrics/) with 6 team members.

## Goal
Effectively help instructors identify students who might be struggling in class

To achieve that, we would need to:
- Proactively track metrics that might signify risk
- Provides **sufficient and relevant information** for instructors to determine if a student is high-risk
- Requires **little maintenance** on the instructorsâ€™ part, notifying only when they need to act

## Risk Metrics
Our team conducted user interviews with 6 professors at Carnegie Mellon, we have ascertain that an initial set of conditions that could help identify potential at-risk students.

| Risk Conditions | Potentially Identifies |
| --- | -- |
| Students who have used *X number* grace (late submission) days by *date* | Poor time / workload management |
| Students whose grades have dropped by *X number* percent within *Y number* consecutive assignments | Gradual slipping of grades |
| Students who did not submit *X number* assignments | Skipping work |
| Students with *X number* submitted assignments below a percentage of *Y number* | Generally weaker students |

## Prototype Iterations 

Together with my team, we iterated on prototypes. Our first idea was that given a set of conditions, a running list of students would be generated. Instructors will return to this page to manage student's progression.

From internal discussions, we realize that it is much more valuable for instructors to not need to actively manage and curate the list. So we decided to have a watchlist that notifies them like an email inbox.

User testing helped us figure out that batch actions are important, and we also then fixed other copywriting issues

With a satisfactory prototype, we proceeded to implement the feature into our application.

## Metrics Feature

Instructors will set up their course as per usual, and then they will set up their **Student Metrics**.

Instructors are then able to refresh and keep track of students in need of attention in the **Watchlist**. They are then able to use it as a work list to keep track of whether a student has been contacted and resolved. Each row of student also has sufficient information to help instructors determine the reason the student is deemed as needing attention.

**Update**: As of Fall 2021, it has been successfully deployed onto CMU's production Autolab, and we have been getting instructors to use the feature.
