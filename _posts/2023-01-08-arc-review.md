What is one word that you use to describe the experience with your browser?

Mine would be the various synonyms of the word: **messy** 

[ARC from the Browser Company of New York](https://arc.net/). It is a reimagination of the browser given how people actually use a browser nowadays. Its intention seemed to be an all inclusive browsing operating system, serving all of your web needs. It has this amazing sidebar that just _helps_ you navigate and organise your web apps and content, but most importantly it really assists me with using the web, instead of fighting against me, thus it  has replaced Edge and Chrome as my new daily driving. 

**Why should I care about browsers?**
The browser is the most used application on people’s computers and the portal to the internet. It’s why Google made Chrome - to direct people to their site, and why Microsoft, upon realising their mistake, keeps trying to win market share back from Chrome. Yet, I don’t think there has been a _good_ fresh take on a new browser until the ARC.

If the ARC browser does win over people’s hearts with its new way of surfing the web, then it will serve to decide the new defaults and new ecosystem of the internet world. 

Its features, including 
- **Boost** which allows users to modify web pages, or 
- **Easel** a scratch book using live content snippets,

will affect how people use websites, and how websites are built too! Websites can better allow itself to be modified, or optimise itself to be added as a snippet to Easel.

Here’s how I think the ARC browser can be further improved

- Easels can easily be __supercharged__. Easels that can be shared amongst friends would be insane - how many often do we share a bunch of amazon links to a friend, just to have them open every link up just to see the images, price and information, when it can be just a link to a board with LIVE snippets?
- Lack of account & syncing across devices: A substantial majority of people use browsers as the main way of storing passwords across their mobile device and computers. Similarly with the notes feature that they currently - if they can’t have a basic shopping list available easily between on their phone and their computer, then it’s hard to start using.

Right now, I’m just simply excited about a new way to surf the web, and to say goodbye to having too many opened windows and tabs.
