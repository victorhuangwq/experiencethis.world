### What impact do you want to have on the world and why?

I want effective teaching to be widely available, so that people can be inspired, understand the content better and enjoy learning.

The right pedagogy matters in education, just as important as the content that is provided. The learning experience of a student will affect their impression of the content and the field that the content is in. Learning how the mechanics of how an airplane works is one thing, being inspired and fascinated by the intricacies while learning is another. This affects who gets inspired to pursue a STEM career, or further studies in History.

I’m personally blessed to have many inspiring teachers during my education, from middle school till college. The way I was taught made me enjoy what I’m learning, and it has guided in what I wanted to pursue. Yet, whenever I discuss with my peers about our respective education journey, it reaffirms my belief that inspirational and effective teaching is a rarity. Poor pedagogy can in fact have the effect of turning people away; I had friends who didn’t learn programming well until college because their introduction to it was poor during high school.

There have been many efforts to provide access to education content to people around the world; I personally want to contribute to that effort by making access to great teaching of the content widely available as well.
