### Describe your most meaningful experience(s) and why they matter to you

I ran an unsuccessful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fiberics/relay-worlds-first-2-in-1-charging-cable-and-belt) together with two friends. In the break before college, we wanted to try our hands at starting a small venture. We invested our own time and funds, and learned how to do things every step of the way. We investigated products on Kickstarter to decide what we could make given our abilities. Then, procured a supplier in China, set up a limited liability partnership, ran social media advertising campaigns. We released it, tried to make sufficient sales, and failed.

More than about developing products, this experience taught me what I should be spending my time and effort on. 

I learnt that I should work on products that solve problems that I’m personally invested in. When the campaign started to show signs of failure - I spent time figuring out how to run better social media ads, instead of learning why people don’t see the value of the product; I was not inherently driven to solve the underlying problem. I also realized that I needed to own the product that I work on, and be proud of it. I was afraid of sharing what I made with my friends and family because I was afraid of judgment, when in fact sharing with them would have gotten us more feedback on the product, and also more potential first customers.

I’m glad I had this experience - I understand that how I personally align with the problem that I'm solving can greatly affect the results.
