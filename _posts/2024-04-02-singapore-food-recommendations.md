Being one of the only Singaporeans in various social situations, I get asked about what to eat in Singapore. It started with a friend asking for a list, and I decided instead of writing it down in a chat, I will send them a Google Maps list. From there, I always had the a list ready to share. Now I'm thinking of writing a more elaborate post about it.

**The List**
> [Victor's SG Food Recommendation](https://maps.app.goo.gl/heKUpPKNc4xs3CGaA)

### Context

The list only has 15 items, and it's not meant to represent all the best places in Singapore. I chose these places because these are the places I have been to, and they are also located closer to the downtown area of Singapore, which I know most of my friends will likely be staying when they visit.

My main thought when choosing these places is to highlight the variety of food in Singapore. I have included a mix of food that I think are unique to Singapore, and generally comfortable for someone foreign to try. i.e. they are not too out there, and is in a comfortable setting.

> This is a work in progress. I will be adding more details to each of the places in the list. I am going to write about what I usually order.

### The List

1. Ya Kun Kaya Toast

Ya Kun Kaya Toast is a chain of cafes in Singapore that serves traditional Singaporean breakfast. This is what I ate at coffee shops growing up in Singapore, and it's a hit with all my friends who visited. 

I usually order the Kaya Toast Set, which comes with Kaya Toast, soft boiled eggs, and coffee or tea. Although I am now a decaf coffee drinker, I can vouch for their dark roasted coffee with condensed milk. 

How I eat it:
- Season the soft boiled eggs with a bit of soy sauce and white pepper
- Dip the Kaya Toast in the eggs.
- Drink the coffee

2. Song Fa Bak Kut Teh

Bak Kut Teh is a pork rib soup that is cooked with garlic, pepper, and other herbs. It's a dish that is popular in Malaysia and Singapore, there's a difference in the way it's cooked in both countries, with Singapore's version being more peppery the soup is clear. It's the way I ate growing up so I prefer it.

Song Fa is a chain of Bak Kut Teh restaurants in Singapore, and it's one of the best places to try it. I was not surprised it won the Michelin Bib Gourmand award when I went back to Singapore in 2023 (and it's been winning it since 2016!).

I usually order the classic set, which comes with pork ribs, rice, and a side of salted vegetables and I think youtiao (fried dough fritters) too?

How I eat it:
- Season the pork ribs with the dark soy sauce and chili (out of the soup)
- Eat the pork ribs with rice, and the salted vegetables
- Drink the soup
- Dip the youtiao in the soup (if you have it)
