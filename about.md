I'm born and raised in Singapore, the amazing sunny island state near the equator. I was last in Singapore in 2023 and I miss the food already.

I'm currently based out of Seattle, Washington. I was for a while in Pittsburgh, PA for my undergraduate studies. I made this website so that I can *somewhat* document all the projects I have worked on, all the musings and ideas that I've had. I try to write to entertain; if you aren't satisfied you can send a strongly worded email to me.

If anything on the site has caught your eyes, feel free to reach out via email to chat with me! 

The amazing sketch of me cutting a cake is done by my friend, [Bradley Teo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradley-teo).
